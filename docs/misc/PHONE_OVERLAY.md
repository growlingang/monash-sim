# Phone Overlay System - Implementation

## 📱 **Persistent Phone Overlay**
The phone is now a **global overlay** that can be accessed from anywhere in the game!

### How It Works:
- **Press P** at any time to open your phone
- **Press P again** or click the **Close** button to close it
- Works in **any scene**: bedroom, campus, during minigames, etc.
- Beautiful modal overlay with blur effect

### Key Features:
✅ **Always accessible** - No need to find a physical phone object
✅ **Doesn't interrupt gameplay** - Overlay appears on top
✅ **Real-time updates** - Shows current stats, time, activity log
✅ **Persistent state** - Your activity log updates as you play

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Created Phone Overlay System (`src/ui/phoneOverlay.ts`)
- Standalone overlay component
- Initializes once at app start
- Listens for 'P' key globally
- Renders on top of all scenes

#### 2. Updated Main App (`src/main.ts`)
- Calls `initPhoneOverlay(store)` on startup
- Phone is now globally available

#### 3. Cleaned Up Bedroom Scene
- Removed phone interaction (E key)
- Removed phone sprite from rendering
- Simplified to just be a room to walk around in
- Updated instructions to say "Press P to open your phone"

#### 4. Removed Phone Scene from Flow
- No longer transitions to separate phone scene
- Bedroom → Morning Commute (phone accessible anytime)
